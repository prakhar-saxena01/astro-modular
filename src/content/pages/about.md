There are minds that crave answers, others that crave understanding. This one has always needed both and much beyond.

This is a home for questions that refuse to be silenced, for thoughts that stretches through the nights and cannot possibly be boxed into narrow categorisations.

This blog is not meant to impress or persuade anyone. Rather this is a record of inquiry, reflections and becoming. "A weird mind" is one that simply refuses to be on auto-pilot.

This blog stands *at the intersection of curiosity and consciousness*. What does it mean to be human?
==This blog covers everything from the evolutionary logic behind the neon colours of a butterfly's wings to the invisible architecture of love, grief, and identity.==

Every essay, every reflection is *==a fragment of continuous and never-ending dialogue==* between a heart that longs to feel and a mind that aches for truth.

I don't claim wisdom. I only claim sincere curiosity. The writings are always going to be inconclusive and maybe really strange.
"Ruminations Of A Weird Mind" is not about escape, but encounter: with thought, with emotions.
STAY. READ. THINK. QUESTION. EVERYTHING.
**Maybe only the weird still wonder.**
