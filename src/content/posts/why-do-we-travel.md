## **Why do we travel?**

There comes a point when the walls of your room begin to hum.  
Not loudly, not dramatically; just a quiet hum, the sound of repetitions. 
 
You’ve looked at the same corner for years, watched the same patch of sunlight shift across the floor, heard the same neighbours chattering. And then, one day, the air inside starts to feel stale, as if your lungs are full of a language that no longer belongs to you. *You don’t know where you want to go, only that you can’t stay.*

**It’s not wanderlust. That’s too glamorous a word.**  
**It’s restlessness. The dull ache of a mind that’s been still for too long.**

And so begins the small, private ritual: you look for solo travel vlogs of places you wished you were at. You'd watch someone visit and enjoy places you'd dreamed of. You're like a god trapped in his own cage, observing everything from above, but unable to experience it yourself.

*Sometimes it’s about distance.* 
*Sometimes it’s just about movement, any movement at all.* 

Because maybe what you really want isn’t another place.
**Maybe it’s another version of yourself.**

## **The Ancestry of Motion**

In the marrow of every human bone lies a whisper: *"**move**"*.
Before we knew how to build, we knew how to walk. 
*Migration was our first religion, hunger our first prophet.* 

Every step forward was *an act of faith*; faith that something existed beyond the horizon. The body has not forgotten this. 
The same blood that once pulsed through wandering tribes now rushes through your veins as you scroll through train tickets, searching for something you can’t quite name.

**Movement is survival disguised as curiosity.**

Even now, when everything we need can be delivered to our doorsteps, there’s still a pulse inside that wants to test the unknown. 
*To move is to reawaken the old muscles of wonder*; to let the senses re-learn the world. 

The smell of petrol at a station, the metallic taste of anticipation, the sound of luggage wheels over uneven tiles. 
They all remind you that you are not fixed, not cemented in place. 
**You are still made of atoms that vibrate.** 
**You are still allowed to change.**
