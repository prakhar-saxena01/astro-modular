## **Why do we travel?**

There comes a point when the walls of your room begin to hum.  
Not loudly, not dramatically — just a quiet hum, the sound of repetition.  
You’ve looked at the same corner for years, watched the same patch of sunlight shift across the floor, heard the same neighbors cough in the mornings. And then, one day, the air inside starts to feel stale, as if your lungs are full of a language that no longer belongs to you. You don’t know where you want to go — only that you can’t stay.

It’s not wanderlust. That’s too glamorous a word.  
It’s restlessness. The dull ache of a mind that’s been still for too long.

And so begins the small, private ritual: you open a map, or Google Earth, or a random YouTube vlog. You zoom in and out, a god trapped in his own cage, surveying the cities he’ll never touch. Sometimes it’s about distance. Sometimes it’s just about movement — any movement at all. Because maybe what you really want isn’t another place. Maybe it’s another version of yourself.
